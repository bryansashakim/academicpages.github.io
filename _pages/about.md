I am an undergraduate student at Boston College studying Mathematics, with concentrations in computational methods and applied economics. I am currently on a leave of absence working as a research assistant to David Cutler (Harvard) and as a member of the Data Core team of the Comparative Health Systems Performance (CHSP) Initiative at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) where I contribute to the creation and maintenance of the Health Systems and Performance Database (HSPD). The project is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and aims at providing evidence on the impact of integrated health systems on treatments and clinical and economic outcomes. 

Besides updating the hospital and physician files of the HSPD, I am also helping DC understand the slowdown in cardiovascular disease mortality reductions in the US, especially among low SES groups. Using various public and restricted data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), we hope to understand mortality trends in the US, and what policy can do to improve health. For example, differential changes in risk factor management among high and low SES groups would support policies that address better control of these risks. In contrast, differential survival given risk might indicate the need to focus on access to acute medical care.
I am currently programming a cox-based risk prediction model based on the Framingham Heart Study to determine a 10-year risk score of cardiovascular disease using a variety of individual level risk factors. Before the NBER I worked as a research assistant to Glenn Ellison at MIT, and spent summers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Compass Lexecon as an intern.

Broadly I'm interested in exploring how algorithms informed by economic theory can be used to address real-world failures such as information asymmetries or inefficiencies in healthcare systems. I am also interested in applying econometric and machine learning techniques to better understand the causal mechanisms affecting social and economic welfare. In this regard, I would like to gain industry experience so I can be exposed to the most cutting-edge tools and research methods in machine learning while building a more solid technical background. My research interests dabble in both theory and applied empirical work: [health](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003769204371), [IO](https://economics.mit.edu/files/7535), [network theory](http://bengolub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homophily-predict.pdf), computational economics, [macro](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.101.6.2530), [urban/spatial](https://yichensu.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/jmp_062420.pdf), [environmental](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092876559390017O), real estate, [labor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535043?seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents), and game theory.
