I am an undergraduate student at Boston College studying Mathematics, with concentrations in computational methods and applied economics. I am currently on a leave of absence working with Professor David Cutler (Harvard) at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The project is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and aims at providing evidence on the impact of integrated health systems on treatments and clinical and economic outcomes. Broadly I'm interested in exploring how algorithms informed by economic theory can be used to address real-world failures such as information asymmetries or inefficiencies in healthcare systems. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to better understand the causal mechanisms affecting social and economic welfare. My research interests include [health](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003769204371), [IO](https://economics.mit.edu/files/7535), [network theory](http://bengolub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homophily-predict.pdf), [macro](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.101.6.2530), [urban/spatial](https://yichensu.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/jmp_062420.pdf), [environmental](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092876559390017O), real estate, [labor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535043?seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents), and game theory.
