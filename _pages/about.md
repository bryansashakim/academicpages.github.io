I am an undergraduate student at Boston College studying Mathematics, with concentration in computational methods and applied economics. I am currently on a leave of absence working with Professor David Cutler (Harvard) at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Broadly I'm interested in exploring how algorithms informed by economic theory can be used to address real-world failures such as information asymmetries or inefficiencies in healthcare systems. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to better understand the causal mechanisms affecting social and economic welfare. My research interests include [health](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003769204371), [IO](https://economics.mit.edu/files/7535), [network theory](http://bengolub.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homophily-predict.pdf), [macro](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.101.6.2530), [urban/spatial](https://yichensu.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/jmp_062420.pdf), and game theory.
