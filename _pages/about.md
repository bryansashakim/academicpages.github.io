I am an undergraduate student at Boston College studying Mathematics. I am currently on a leave of absence to work under Professor David Cutler (Harvard) at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Broadly I am interested in exploring how algorithms informed by economic theory can be used to address real-world failures such as information asymmetries or inefficiencies in healthcare systems. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to better understand the causal mechanisms affecting social and economic welfare. My research interests include macro, health, IO, urban/spatial, and game theory.
