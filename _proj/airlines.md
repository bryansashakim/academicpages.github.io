title: "The Spirit Effect: Implications of the Entry of Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers on Airfares"
excerpt: "It's been shown that Low-Cost Carriers such as Southwest introduce competitive effects in relevant markets. In this (very much working and unfinished) paper, I attempt to use origin and destination data from the Bureau of Transportation to analyze the impact of Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers (ULCCs) on the airfares of threatened markets where legacy and similar budget airlines operate. I use a difference-in-differences approach with multiple model specifications on markets where ULCCs have entered in said time periods. <br/><img src='/images/frontier_vs_spirit_ulcc.jpg'>"
