title: "Family Units"
excerpt: 'This is an algorithm written in R that attempts to simulate virus progression and system states among a "family unit" of students that stick together in University. Similar to Testing Pods but this is simpler in that here I construct a vector of individuals and vector of time indexes, rather than a matrix of individuals and states in continuous time. The algorithm iterates through the family unit with key parameters to determine things like the fraction of the people in the family who are ever exposed to the virus and how the total amount of time that people are infectious varies with the size of the group and the testing interval delta, among other things. <br/><img src="/images/Infection Time (n~(2,20), del=2-1.png">'
