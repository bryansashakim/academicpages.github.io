title: "Implications of Heterogeneous SIR Models for Analyses of COVID-19"
collection: ra
permalink: /ra/covid2020
excerpt: 'Paper Abstract: This paper provides a quick survey of results on the classic SIR model and variants allowing for heterogeneity in contact rates. It notes that calibrating the classic model to data generated by a heterogeneous model can lead to forecasts that are biased in several ways and to understatement of the forecast uncertainty. Among the biases are that we may underestimate how quickly herd immunity might be reached, underestimate differences across regions, and have biased estimates of the impact of endogenous and policy-driven social distancing.\
Contributions: Wrote R code to program the SIR model of hetergeneous multipopulations differing in their "activity" levels. Two model versions include uniform matching and homophilic matching behaviors. Also produced relevant graphs with ggplot2 which can be viewed in the link.'
